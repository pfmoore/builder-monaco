This Project
============

This project automates the process of building the Monaco program. Monaco's
README file is included below.

Monaco ReadMe File
==================

This program, known as "Monaco", allows you to produce answers to some problems
that involve random effects, such as are produced by dice or cards. These will
typically be problems of forms such as "How likely is this?", "What is the
average value of that?", or "What is the distribution of that?".

The program should be supplied as either of both of:

- One or more executable files, each for a particular operating system. They
  might have names like monaco, monaco.exe and/or monaco.command.

- C++ source code files, with .h and .cpp extensions, that you can compile to
  produce such an executable file. There are a few comments about how to create
  an executable file from source code files in the first appendix to the main
  document described below, but they assume you have some idea how to do this.

In addition to this file the following documentation should have been provided:

- A PowerPoint presentation "Monaco Introduction.ppt", which as its name
  suggests is a basic introduction to what the program is. If you do not use
  PowerPoint then there should also be a PDF version of this presentation.

- Three further PDF files that are documents rather than presentations. (Their
  original versions, which are not provided, are in Word.) These are:

  + "Monaco Teaser.pdf". This presents some examples that the program can handle -
    all taken from the following file. But in each case it provides only a
    statement of the problem and some output from which the solution can be
    determined. (The parameters used are provided, unexplained, as a final note
    at the end of the file.) As the file name suggests, the aim is to indicate
    why this program might be useful and worth considering further.

  + "Monaco Documentation.pdf". The main documentation file. This provides a
    mixture of introductory, tutorial and reference material. It is a long
    document, but eighty percent of it is appendices, many of which you will not
    need.

  + "Monaco Tutorial.pdf". A tutorial that uses a series of examples to
    introduce you to features of the program and how they can be used to solve
    real problems.

Also, within the main documentation file, as its Appendix LL and Appendix MM,
there are much shorter self-contained descriptions of two simpler concept
programs; you can run the actual program if it were just one of those concepts.
The first of these only handles some dice problems, the second can handle a
range of dice and card problems. The latter does not have all the capability of
the full program, but you can still do a lot with it.

Finally, there are also a text document changes.txt that summarises the main
changes in the program from version to version. Unless you are a regular user of
the program, you can ignore this file.
